This is the [Go](http://golang.org) library for
[Frisbee](https://loopholelabs.io/docs/frisbee), a bring-your-own protocol messaging framework designed for performance and stability.

**This library requires Go1.16 or later.**

## Important note about releases and stability

This repository generally follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). However, **this library is currently in
Beta** and is still considered experimental. Breaking changes of the library will _not_ trigger a new major release. The
same is true for selected other new features explicitly marked as
**EXPERIMENTAL** in CHANGELOG.md.

## Usage

Documentation and example usage is available at [https://loopholelabs.io/docs/frisbee][homepage].

## RPC Generator Usage

The included RPC Generator is still in very early **Alpha**. While it is functional and being used within other products
we're building at [Loophole Labs][loophomepage], the `Proto3` spec has a myriad of edge-cases that make it difficult to
guarantee validity of generated RPC frameworks.

That being said, as the library matures and usage of the RPC framework grows we'll be able to increase our testing
coverage and fix any edge case bugs. One of the major benefits to the RPC framework is that reading the generated code
is extremely straight forward, making it easy to debug potential issues down the line.

### Unsupported Features

The Frisbee RPC Generator currently does not support:

- `OneOf` Message Types
- Streaming Messages between the client and server

Example `Proto3` files can be found [here](/pkg/rpc/examples).
